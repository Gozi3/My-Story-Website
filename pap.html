        <p>Now I'm going to tell you the names and also about some of the dimensions in the portal. There's Lego World which is a place where everything is made of Lego. It's exactly like Earth except made of Lego. Next is DragonBallZ Universe. Here you
            can join the Super Saiyans and battle against evil. Then there's DC Universe. Here you can see Superman and the other DC superheroes such as Batman and the Green Lantern. The next dimension is Marvel Universe. In Marvel Universe you can talk
            to the Fantastic Four, The Avengers and many other Marvel superheroes. That's a few. There are lots more! Now out of my team-mates there are two groups 'The Phoenix Elementals' and 'The Phoenix Legionaries'.
            <br/>These are my team-mates in The Phoenix Elementals:
            <br/>Powerman (that's me): I have Aerokinesis, Geokinesis, Pyrokinesis, Hydrokinesis, Cryokinesis, Electrokinesis;
            <br/>Powerwoman: She has Dynamokinesis, Energy Blasts, Energy Emission, Photokinesis;
            <br/>Electro: He has Electrokinesis, Activation and Deactivation, Electrical Transportation and Electric Mimicry;
            <br/>Electra: She has Photokinesis, Laser Emission, Light Generation and Light Mimicry;
            <br/>StarCat: He has Heliokinesis, Plasmakinesis, Light Absorption and Pyrotechnics;
            <br/>These are my team-mates in The Phoenix Legionaries:
            <br/>Flameboy: He has Pyrokinesis, Geo-Thermokinesis, Thermokinesis, Fire Breathing;
            <br/>Gymnasta Girl: She has Elasticity, Malleable Anatomy;
            <br/>LightForce: He has Photoportation, Light Mimicry and Time Manipulation;
            <br/>SpeedyX: He has Aerokinesis, Aeroportation, Air Mimicry, Wind Generation;
            <br/>Aquagirl: She hasHydrokinesis, Aquatic Adaptation, Cryokinesis, Ice Generation, Ice Beam and Freezing;
            <br/>Metollo: He has Geokinesis, Ferrokinesis, Terrakinesis and Terraportation;
            <br/>Shrinkara: She has Size Reduction and Size Enhancement;

            <br/>Multiplier F: She has Multi-Shape-shifting, Force-Field Generation Telekinetic Pull/Push;
            <br/>Shaparama: He has Biomorphing, Mechanical Morphing, Elemental Mimicry, Shape-shifting Inducement</p>
        <p>And those are my team-mates. There are quite a lot of super-villains always lurking around, and when they cause trouble we bring them to justice. These are some of them: Magneta, Solar Boom, Nova Flame, Elemental Striker, Battle Death, Dark Phoenix,
            Mirage Master, Metallite, Static Wind, Chrono-King, Mandroid, Sonic Howl, Solar Boom, Droideck, Illuminatrix, Elemental Ninja, and so many others.
            <br/>Anyway many different enemies come to attack every now and then.
            <br/>There are a lot of super villains in many dimensions such as:
            <br/>Acmetropolis, Lego World, Utopia, Marvel Universe, DC Universe, Dragonball Universe and so many others. They come to destroy the peace and tranquillity that's there. But we come to bring it back!</p>
