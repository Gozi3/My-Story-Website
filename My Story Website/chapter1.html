            <p>Anyway, back to the story. I was working on my new invention called the Tri-Machine, and finally finished it at last! Then I went to test it in the testing arena, to see whether it worked or not and if it worked as good as I thought. So, I
                turned on the enemy robots the lasers and the jungle and safari environment, to see if it could work perfectly in such conditions. I changed the Tri-Machine into a supersonic car and automatically, just like I programmed, the jungle wheels
                in the supersonic car came out and the guns and lasers started shooting at the enemy robots. "Great, it works perfectly... in the jungle. Hmm, let's see if it can still operate in thunderstorms and extreme types of weathers from different
                places" I said. So I decided to change the environment to that of Climatia's, which was a planet known to have various, extreme types of weather including thunderstorms, with a lot of lightning, and tornadoes. Then it occurred to me, "Hmm,
                would it be able to fly in space?". So I tested the pressure it could handle and it was even able to handle a pressure a higher than that of space. "Great! Anyway back to the climate test" I said happily, "Computer, change surroundings
                to Climatia's". The first extreme weather type I chose was a huge thunderstorm with plenty of lightning. I turned the Tri-Machine into a supersonic jet and started flying through the thundery sky. Then when lightning struck the jet the
                lightning shields I designed automatically turned on and deflected the bolt of lightning away from the jet. Then I flew straight at the tornado and the wind shields kicked in and stabilised the jet. "Awesome!" I shouted, happy to see to
                see my invention working. After realising that the Tri-Machine could work well in windy and electric conditions I then changed the climate very hot, and the Tri-Machine was able to perform perfectly. Deciding to see how much heat it could
                handle I changed the surroundings to that of the sun, and it worked just as well as it did in the hot climate of Climatia's. I switched the surroundings back to Climatia's, and went to a very cold climate. The temperature was at absolute
                zero, which is the coldest temperature ever that can be reached. The engine's fuel started to freeze as it got closer to absolute zero, so had to adjust the vehicle to inject a special liquid called Heathium into the fuel when the temperature
                got too cold, to stop the fuel from freezing. After doing that I tested it again and it worked perfectly. Then I changed the surroundings to a poisonous planet to see if it could withstand various poisonous gases and acids. It worked well,
                then I changed the Tri-Machine into a supersonic aqua-boat and when into the toxic, swampy oceans and it worked perfectly as well. When I had finished testing the Tri-Machine in the testing arena, I went to the galactic mail room to see
                if we had any mail. There was an envelope there. "I wonder what this is" I said. I opened the envelope to meet an invitation to the annual 'Ultimate Galactic Race' held every year on Acmetropolis. On the envelope it said "To the members
                of 'The Phoenix Elementals' and 'The Phoenix Legionaries' superhero team, you are invited to watch or participate in the annual 'Ultimate Galactic Race' competition. Racers from all across the galaxy will be there to attend in this magnificent
                race. Beware! Not only are many of the racers well experienced but their cars as well will be state of the art. If you are to participate in the race, show-up one week in advance and you will be entered into to it. Admission for the race
                is free, and all that's needed is you, your crew and your car. Expenses for getting to the race, buying equipment for your vehicle and other things needed for the race will not be included and will have to be paid by the person purchasing
                it. "Awesome! I can't wait to tell the rest of the team about the invitation, and also about my new invention, 'The Tri-Machine'. I gathered my team-mates together. "Hey guys, We got an invitation to 'The Ultimate Galactic Race' and I
                was wondering if anyone would like to go to it with me" I said. "I once watched 'The Ultimate Galactic Race'. It's awesome! You get to watch different kinds of racing machines racing across the galaxy" said Electro. "So who wants to enter
                it with me?" I asked "Me", shouted twelve voices coming from all around the room. I looked around and there was Powerwoman, Electro, Electra, Flameboy, LightForce, SpeedyX, Aquagirl, Metollo, Shrinkara, Spikeboy, Multiplier I, and Multiplier
                F. "OK", I said. "What about the rest of you guys? Don't you want to come?" I said. "Nah, I think we'll hang back. Plus someone's gotta take care of the other planets and protect the people from the bad guys while you guys are gone", said
                StarCat. "Good point. Oh, and guys by the way, I just created a brand new invention". I removed the cover from the Tri-Machine."WOW!", exclaimed everybody. "You have definitely outdone yourself this time", said Electra with a smile."Wait
                a second... did Electro help you?" said StarCat."No, he didn't, I did it all by myself. It took a while but it was worth the time." I said. "Ha! Yeah Right, as if you did that all by yourself." said StarCat. "But I did..." "Its true guys
                he did do it on his own. I didn't help him with it" interrupted Electro, "I'm impressed. Good job". "...OK, fine! I believe you" replied StarCat after a short pause,"So what's it called anyway?". "I call it the 'Tri-Machine' because it
                can turn into three things, a supersonic jet, a supersonic car, and a supersonic aqua-boat." I said as I demonstrated for them. "Wow, Cool," said everyone excitedly. "That's gotta be more than what we need to win the race" said Flameboy.
                "True, but don't forget other racers from all around the galaxy are coming to race. They may have stuff that we might not have even dreamt of, never mind building", I said. "Well?" said Flameboy. "Well what?" I asked back. "Well you'll
                never know until you actually check them out!" said Flameboy excitedly. "What do you mean?" I asked confused. "Why don't we actually go to the place to check out the other racer's car, and see whether we need to change or modify The Tri-Machine",
                said Flameboy. "Good idea! Guys lets go" I said. "Actually I don't think we should go" said Electro. "Why?" we asked. "Well, I was watching the intergalactic news yesterday and it said there are going to be freak thunderstorms this week
                and..." "That won't stop us. The Tri-Machine can handle anything; it has elemental shields, which include lightning shields, fire shields, ice shields..." "I know what it includes, I invented them" mumbled Electro. So we started on our
                way to the place where the Ultimate Galactic Race was going to be held. When we entered Acmetropolis there was thunder and lightning everywhere. Then suddenly the Tri-Machine started shaking. "Whoa!" said everyone. "I told you the Tri-Machine
                can't handle it" said Electro. "Yes, it can" I said. It shakes again. "Whoa!" said everyone. "Ah, I see what's wrong I forgot to turn the elemental shields on". I switched it on. "There we go" I said happily, and The Tri-Machine stopped
                shaking and gently flew. "There's the cave! Let's land there" said Electra. "Are you sure that's it? It looks like Metollo just destroyed a mountain!" I exclaimed, "No offence, Metollo" I said turning to him."None taken..." he replied.
                "The thunderstorm must have done this to it" said Electra. Then I gently landed the Tri-Machine. "I hope the thunderstorm didn't damage the Tri-Machine too much" I said. "Forget that! Let's see what the other vehicles look like" said Powerwoman.
                "Err, how are we going to get it into the cave" said Aquagirl. "Well, Shrinkara and I were already working on that, and we made this gun that shrinks large objects and increases it back to its original size" said Electro. "Well what are
                you waiting let's test it" I said. "Alright!" said Electro. He aimed the gun at it and shot it with the Shrink-Ray Gun. "Great it works!" I said. "Yes, now we can go" said Powerwoman. I shrunk the Tri-Machine and put it in my pocket. "I
                don't think it's a good idea to keep it in your pocket" said Flameboy. "Well where else do you want me to put it?" I asked him. "Well, you could always Portal Gun we made. You know the one that creates a small portal to our HQ for short
                amount of time.We can zap it to the Vehicle Room" said Flameboy. "Okay" I said. I created a portal to be positioned at the Vehicle Room with the Portal Gun and put the now mini-sized Tri-Machine in there.</p>
