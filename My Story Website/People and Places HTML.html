		<p>Now I'm going to tell you the names and also about some of the dimensions in the portal. There's Legoworld which is a place where everything is made of Lego. 
		It's exactly like Earth except made of Lego. Next is Sweet Street. In this dimension instead of money they use paper and almost everything are made from sweets and there are only sweets and chocolate in Sweet Street. 
		Next is DragonBallZ land. Here you can join the Super Saiyans and battle against evil. Then there's DC Universe. Here you can see Superman and the other DC superheroes such as Batman and the Green Lantern. 
		The next dimension is Marvel Universe. In Marvel Universe you can talk to the Fantastic Four, The Avengers and many other Marvel superheroes. 
		That's a few there are lots more! Now out of my teammates there are two groups 'The Supersixes' and 'The Fifteenics'.
