            <p>After that we walked into the cave and went up some stairs into a dome like room. In the middle of the room, there were swords in a circle floating in the air with the point facing upwards. In the middle of them, on a table made of a diamond,
                was a letter. The letter read 'Welcome to the Cave of Races. Above the table, you will find twelve swords. When you take your sword it will float back up and then start glowing. This means that the sword has calibrated itself to be carried
                only by you. As you progress into the cave you will find different kinds of monsters, some of which are friendly and some of which are not. This is due to the fact that the thunderstorm has frightened many monsters causing them to flee
                to this cave, so be careful.' So each of us took a sword and just as the letter said the swords floated and started glowing. After a while the swords stopped glowing and gently floated back down. We then took our swords and headed further
                on into the cave. As we were walking all of a sudden there were small rumbling sounds coming from the walls. "What do you guys think that was?" asked Shrinkara. Then there was a loud roar. "I think that was a Spike-bear" I said. "What's
                that?" asked Shrinkara in a scared voice. "It's a bear with spikes on its back" I replied. "Oh, this should be fun." said Aquagirl sarcastically. "It's ok, we're superheroes we can handle them" I said. "Them? Oh, boy" said Shrinkara. Then
                suddenly two big Spike-bears smashed through the side walls of the cave, stood in front of us and roared. "Guys get ready!" I shouted. One bear leaped right at me but I used an ice shield to defend myself and pushed him away with a blast
                of wind. The bear snarled at me. "Guys, take the second bear. Powerwoman and I will take this one." "Alright" said the rest. Powerwoman ran at the bear and attacked it with her sword. Then the bear let out a huge roar and leaped back at
                her but missed. I froze the bear by manipulating the water on the ground and turn it to ice, and then Powerwoman killed it with a blast of energy. After that we ran to the rest others and helped them kill the other bear. "Wow! They are
                strong. Imagine if there was a group of them or even a King Spike-bear. What would we do?" said Shrinkara. I don't think the king would be here and if there is a group of them I'm sure we would be able to handle them" I said. "Oh, and
                I saw this yellow thing from the remains of it glowing on the ground" said Shrinkara. Electro stopped to look at it. "I don't think I've seen this before. Let me scan it under the Electromagnetic Identifier" said Electro. "What's an Electromagnetic
                Identifier?" asked Multiplier I confused. "The Electromagnetic Identifier or EMI, as I like to call it, is a device that tells you what something is by scanning for vibrations, pulses and other stuff you probably won't understand'" said
                Electro. "So what is it?" asked Multiplier F curiously. "Well, from what I'm reading here, it's called an Absorber, which is a powerful crystal that can make your armour or weapon absorb energy blasted at it if used correctly, but that's
                only if it's electrically combined with armour or swords" said Electro. "Cool, let's test it" said Shrinkara excitedly. "Well, seeing as you don't have any armour I'll upgrade your sword?" asked Electro. "Hey, why does she get the upgrade?"
                asked SpeedyX grumpily. "She gets it because she found it" answered Powerwoman. Then Shrinkara's sword started glowing. After a while it stopped glowing and turned yellow. "Let's see if it really works" said LightForce. "Ok. Wait, Electro
                said if used correctly. What does that mean?" asked Shrinkara worried. "It means that you have to make sure the blast of energy hits the blade of the sword. And it only absorbs it as long as it's touching the blade of the sword and if
                it hits anywhere else on the sword the regular effect occurs" said Electro. "Oh, alright" said Shrinkara. Then Powerwoman shot a weak blast of energy straight at the blade and just as the EMI said it would it absorbed the energy. "Wow,
                I didn't even feel anything. I didn't even struggle to hold it" said Shrinkara. "Great! now we know it works" said SpeedyX in a sulk. "Don't be angry I'm sure there are more monsters for you to fight and get crystals from, just look out
                for them" said Powerwoman. "Okay" said SpeedyX grumpily. And we continued on our journey through the cave. We were walking when all of a sudden, Electro stopped. "What's wrong?" I said. "There are two paths" said Electro. "Well, which
                do we take?" asked LightForce. "Well... according to the Echo Pathfinder..." said Electro. "Wait, what's an Echo Pathfinder?" asked Electra. "An Echo Pathfinder or EP is a device that can map a certain area by using echoes" said Electro.
                Electra gives him a confused look. "Anyway which way do we take?" said Electra. "Well, from what I see here there are a lot of monsters both ways and underneath both of them is a room full of gold coins and crystals which can be useful
                in upgrading machines, weapons and armour, so I think we should split up" said Electro. "Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. Ok, Electro, Electra, Aquagirl, SpeedyX, Multiplier I and Shrinkara you guys go to the right path. Powerwoman,
                Flameboy, LightForce, Metollo, Multiplier F and I will go to the left path. Electro, I'll be in contact with you and your group with our comm-links" . "Ok. According to the EP one of us from each of our group will have to blast through
                the ground to the Treasure Room. I suggest Metollo. He's the perfect person from your group to do that as he can create a hole from the ground" said Electro. "Alright, no problem" replied Metollo. "What about our group Electro who will
                do it from our group?" Shrinkara asked. "I will. I can concentrate a beam of light to create a laser that will cut out a hole" replied Electra. And with that we went our separate ways. Electro and his group went to the right path and my
                group and I went to the left path. After a while, as we were walking Powerwoman stopped. "What's wrong?" I asked. "Look over there" said Powerwoman in astonishment. I turned my focus to the left to meet five Elemental Water Monsters. "So?
                No problem I can handle them" said Flameboy. "Don't get too confident. Elemental Water Monsters can combine with each other to form a Mega Elemental Water Monster" I said. "Oh, well that's just great now isn't it?" said Flameboy sarcastically.
                "I'll start off. Follow my lead" I said. So I ran straight up at the first monster and attacked him with my sword, but then the monsters started attacking me. Then one of them threw me at a wall. Then Flameboy shot him with big ball of
                fire, while Multiplier F shielded me with a force field. Then Flameboy ran up to one of them and smashed it straight through a wall destroying it with his fists of fire. "Nice work, keep going" I said in a rugged voice. Then Metollo controlled
                the two sides of the cave smashed one of them in the head stunning it and then he controlled the rocks to cover his fist and then ran at the monster and kicked it to the side of the cave destroying it. After that LightForce turned into
                light and flashed over to the third monster blinding it and then ran straight through it at the speed of light slicing it in half. He was about to go through the fourth one, but then it combined with the fifth one to form a Mega Elemental
                Water Monster. "Oh wow, that is one big monster" said Flameboy. "Told you so" I said jokingly. "Forget that, how are we going to fight that thing?" said Flameboy. "Let's try hitting it together" I said. "At the same time?" asked LightforceX.
                "No. I have a plan. LightforceX blinds the monster with a flash of light then Metollo, locks his legs his to the ground by controlling the ground. After that Powerwoman and I will shoot it with a blast of elemental energy while Flameboy
                blasts it with fire and Multiplier F protects us with a force field" I said. "Ehh sorry, could you run me through that again. I forgot to take notes" said Flameboy sarcastically. "No time! Let's go" I said in return. And just like my plan
                LightforceX first blinded it with a flash of light then Metollo locked it to the ground. After that Powerwoman and I started blasting it with energy and lightning while Flameboy blasted the monster with fire and Multiplier F shield us
                from its water attacks, with a force field. But still that wasn't enough for the monster. "Now what do we do" asked Flameboy. "I have an idea" I said. Then I charged up my sword with lightning and attacked it with my sword and then the
                monster finally fell to its knees dead. "Great, we've finally killed this, thing" said Flameboy. "Finally! It was starting to get on my nerves" muttered Metollo. "How is the other group doing?" asked Powerwoman. "I don't know, let me check"
                I replied. I switched my comm-link on. "Hey, Electro come in. Hello?" I asked. "Oh hey, yeah we're kinda busy"said Electro. A loud lightning sound booms from the comm-link "...yeah guys, err... they're battling a monster" I said with worried
                look in my eye. "Finally we're done. How about you guys?" asked Electro with a sigh of relief. "Oh we were already done. We just wanted to see how far you guys were. Anyway we're going down to the Treasure Room meet you on the other side.
                Over and out" I replied. "Alright, let's do this" said Metollo. And with that he made a hole in the ground by controlling the earth beneath us. Then we jumped down and landed in a room filled with crystals and gold. "Wow. So this is the
                Treasure Room... nice. I like it" said LightForce with a smile. "Let's take as much as we can" said Flameboy. "Well seeing as there's no-one else that could possibly own this, why not?" I said. I created a portal and positioned it in the
                HQ Treasure Room and filled it with the gold coins and crystals. Then a few seconds later, six people fell from a hole in the ceiling which was blasted by a laser beam. It was Electro and his group. "Phew, it's nice to see you guys again"
                said Powerwoman with a sigh. "Same" replied Electra. "Now, according to the EP there should be a door right about here" said Electro touching a part of the wall. Electro looked to find that there was no door. "Err... Electro are you sure
                you're reading that thing correctly, cause there doesn't seem to be a door there..."said SpeedyX with a slight chuckle. "Yes I can see that!" said Electro angrily. "What's wrong with this thing? I've checked it over and over again and
                there's supposed to be a door here" sighed Electro giving it a few taps. "Hey, maybe it's a fake wall. Let me try smashing it" said Metollo. "Err, I don't think that's a good..." Before Electro could finish the sentence, Metollo controlled
                a large boulder from the wall and hurled it straight at the point where the door should have been. It smashed straight through the wall. Metollo smiled. "Don't even think about it" said Electro angrily. "Told you so" said Metollo with
                a big grin on his face. "Ok, I think we should stop here for the night to rest and upgrade our equipment" I said. "Here? Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea... a monster called just break in here and rip us to shreds" said Flameboy.
                "It'll be ok. I'll just reinforce these walls with some of the gold we got by morphing it" replied Metollo happily. "Plus you've got me!" exclaimed Multiplier F. "And me..."said Multiplier I. Flameboy looked at him confused."I can make
                you guys invisible so the monsters don't see you!"he exclaimed."Yeah ok" sighed Flameboy. While Electro and I were upgrading the equipment Metollo started reinforcing the walls with the gold we found there, and the rest of the gold was
                used to reinforce the our armour, swords and gadgets. After we had done that we went to sleep there for the night. The morning after that I awoke to hear banging sounds, after a while the others also woke up. "What was that?" asked Shrinkara
                in a scared voice. "Calm down calm down, it's probably just another monster" muttered Metollo. "A m-monster?" asked Flameboy in a quiet voice. "Yes, your not afraid are you?" asked Metollo with a grin. "No... not at all. Nothings better
                than starting the morning MONSTERS FOR BREAKFAST" shouted Flameboy sarcastically. "Will you to keep it down? They'll hear us" said Powerwoman in a quiet voice. Suddenly the monster started ramming the reinforced wall. "What kind of monster
                does that sound like Electro?" asked Shrinkara. "I don't know let me check the MI..." replied Electro and with that everyone looked at him with a bewildered look on their faces. "MI is short for Monster Identifier," explained Electro with
                a sigh "An MI can identify a monster by its voice, picture or sample of its DNA" continued Electro. "So have you scanned it yet?" asked Shrinkara worried. "Yes, it seems to be an Earth Rhino" replied Electro. "What's that?" asked Flameboy
                shakily. "Imagine Metollo shaped like a Rhino but only able to control earth" explained Electro. "No problem I can control almost any solid object" said Metollo confidently. Then the Earth Rhino smashed through the wall and confronted
                us. "Err, you never said it was huge" whispered Spikeboy shakily. "I said it was a rhino. Rhinos are huge" whispered Electro sternly. "I don't care whether it's huge or not, I'm going to make it crumble" shouted Metollo, and with that
                he charged with his fists reinforced with gold and broke the horns on the rhino's head. The rhino shook its head in frustration and charged at Metollo. Then Multiplier F shielded Metollo with a force field. "Thanks" said Metollo. "No problem"
                answered Multiplier F grinning. "You can't take it out on your own, Metollo" I shouted, "It's too powerful, we need to work together". "What should we do, Electro?" asked Multiplier I. "The MI says an Earth Rhino's weakest point is its
                belly. Let's try hitting it there" suggested Electro. "But how are we supposed to hit it there if it keeps charging at us?" asked Shrinkara. "Simple, Multiplier I turns Electra invisible. Electra goes under the rhino and shoots it with
                her laser beam" I answered. "M-me?" asked Electra. "Yes... you" I nodded. "Fine, as long as you guys distract it" she muttered. "I've got that covered" replied Multtplier I woth a grin, and with that Multiplier I duplicated himself to
                surround the rhino and turned Electra invisible. Electra straight for the Rhino's belly while we were distracting it. Once she was below the belly of the Earth Rhino, Metollo surrounded it with four walls shooting up from the ground by
                the earth beneath us. But the Rhino controlled the wall in front of it back down to the ground. Before the monster could charge at us Electra shot a blast of concentrated beam of light at the Rhino's belly, defeating it. "Wow, that was
                harder than I thought" exclaimed Metollo. "Hey guys, the Earth Rhino came out of another room" shouted Aquagirl. Everyone went to look at the room she was talking about. It was a dome-shaped room with three other rooms connected to it.
                In the middle of the room was a man. He looked like a guide. "Excuse me, sir but who are you?" I asked. "I am Speed Lightning. I'm a racing guide" he answered, "You guys are the Phoenix Elementals. It is...", "And Legionaries" coughed
                Flameboy."-an honour to meet you guys. How may I help?" continued Speed while staring at Flameboy. "We just wanted to know where those doors lead to" explained Electro. "Well that's easy! The first door leads to the Galactic Racing Store
                where you can buy vehicles as well as equipment, weapons, fuel and upgrades for your vehicle..."explained Speed, "What currency does the store accept?" asked Powerwoman. "There is a special Galactic Card that you can get in the store with
                which you can top-up with any currency. The exchange rates are shown as well" replied Speed. "What currency do the cards use?" asked Powerwoman. "They use Galactic Credits or GC if you want to call it that" replied Speed, "The second room
                is a Testing Area, where you can test your vehicle and see if it is up to the standard you wanted it to be" continued Speed, "Cool, can't wait to check that out!" exclaimed Electro. "And the third room is the entrance to the Ultimate Galactic
                Race. Unfortunately the room is locked so as to ensure that the track is not tampered with before the race and to keep most monsters away. Although it will be opened three days before the big race" explained Speed. "Ok guys, I think we
                should go to the Galactic Race Shop to see if there is anything for us to change in the Tri-Machine, and to get the Galactic card" I suggested. With that everyone nodded in agreement and went to the Galactic Racing Store.
