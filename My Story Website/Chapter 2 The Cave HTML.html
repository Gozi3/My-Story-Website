		<p>After that we walked into the cave and went up some stairs into a dome like room. 
		In the middle of the room were swords in a circle floating in the air facing upwards. 
		In the middle of them on a white table made of crystals was a letter. 
		The letter read 'Welcome to the Cave of Races. 
		Beside you, you will find twelve swords. 
		When you take your sword it will float back up and then start glowing and the powers which you can shoot will be in your sword. 
		As you progress into the cave you will find different kinds of monsters, some of which are friendly and some of which are not this is due to the fact that the thunderstorm has frightened many monsters causing them to flee to this cave, so be careful.' 
		So each of us took a sword and just as the letter said the swords floated and started glowing.  
		After a while the swords stopped glowing and gently floated back down. 
		We then took our swords and headed further on into the cave. 
		As we were walking all of a sudden we there were small rumbling sounds coming from the walls. 
		"What do you guys think that was?" asked Shrinkara. 
		Then there was a loud roar. "I think that was a spiked-bear" I said. 
		"What's that?" asked Shrinkara in a scared voice. "It's a bear with spikes on its back" I replied. "Oh... this should be fun." said Shrinkara sarcastically. 
		"It's ok, we're superheroes we can handle them" I said. "Them? Oh, boy" said Aquagirl. 
		Then suddenly two big spiked-bears smashed through the side walls of the cave, stood in front of us and roared. "Guys get ready!" I shouted. 
		One bear leaped right at me but I used an ice shield to defend myself and pushed him away with a blast of wind. 
		The bear snarled at me. "Guys, take the second bear. Powerwoman and I will take this one." 
		"Alright" said the rest. "Let's do this" I said. 
		Powerwoman ran at the bear and attacked it with her sword. 
		Then the bear let out a huge roar and leaped back at her but missed. 
		Then I stunned the bear by shocking it with a bolt of lightning and then Powerwoman and I killed it by blasting it together with a huge ball of fire.
		After that we flew to the rest others and helped them kill the other bear. 
		"Wow! They were strong. Imagine if there was a group of them or even the king of the bears what would we do?" said Shrinkara. 
		I don't think the king would be here and if there is a group of them I'm sure we would be able to handle them" I said. 
		"Oh, and I saw this yellow thing from the remains of it glowing on the ground" said Shrinkara. 
		With that Electro stoppedto look at it. 
		"I don't think I've seen this before. Let me scan it under the Electromagnetic Identifier" said Electro. 
		"What's an Electromagnetic Identifier?" asked Multiplier I confused. 
		"The Electromagnetic Identifier or EMI, as I like to call it, is a device that tells you what something is" said Electro.
		"So what is it?" asked Multiplier F curiously. 
		"Well, from what I'm reading here, it's called an Absorber, which is a powerful crystal that can make your armour or weapon absorb energy blasted at it if used correctly, but that's only if it's electrically combined with your armour or weapon" said Electro. 
		"Cool, let's test it" said Shrinkara excitedly. 
		"Ok. Do you want me to upgrade it to your armour or weapon?" asked Electro. "My armour" said Shrinkara. 
		"Hey, why does she get the upgrade?" asked SpeedoX's grumpily. "She gets it because she found it" answered Powerwoman. 
		Then Shrinkara's armour started glowing. After a while it stopped glowing and turned yellow. 
		"Let's see if it really works" said LightforceX. "Ok. Wait, Electro said if used correctly. What does that mean?" asked Shrinkara worried. "Oh that only applies to weapons" "You have to make sure the blast of energy hits the point of the sword.
		And it only absorbs it as long as it's touching the point of the sword and if it hits anywhere else on the sword the regular effect occurs" said Electro.
		"Oh, alright" said Shrinkara. Then Powerwoman shot a weak blast of energy straight at the armour and just as the EMI said it would it absorbed the energy. 
		"Wow, I didn't even feel anything" said Shrinkara. "Great! now we know it works" said SpeedoX sarcastically. 
		"Don't be angry I'm sure there are more monsters for you to fight and get crystals from, just look out for them" said Powerwoman. 
		"Okay" said SpeedoX grumpily. And we continued on our journey through the cave. We were walking when all of a sudden, Electro stopped. 
		"What's wrong?" I said. "There are two paths" said Electro. "Well, which do we take?" asked LightforceX. "Well... according to the Echo Pathfinder..." said Electro. "Wait, what's an Echo Pathfinder?" asked Electra. 
		"An Echo Pathfinder or EP is a device that can map a certain area by using echoes" said Electro. "Anyway which way do we take?" said Electra. 
		"Well, from what I see here there are a lot of monsters both ways and underneath both of them is a room full of gold coins and crystals which can be useful in upgrading machines, weapons and armour, so I think we should split up" said Electro. 
		"Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. Ok, Electro, Electra, Aquagirl, SpeedoX, Multiplier I and Shrinkara you guys go to the right path. Powerwoman, Flameboy, LightforceX, Metollo, Multiplier F and I will go to the left path. Electro, I'll be in contact with you and your group with our comm-links" I said. 
		"Ok. According to the EP one of us from each of our group will have to blast through the ground to the Treasure Room. I suggest Metollo. He's the perfect person from your group to do that as he can create a hole from the ground" said Electro. 
		"Alright, no problem" replied Metollo. "What about our group Electro who will do it from our group?" Shrinkara asked. "I will" replied Electro. And with that we went our separate ways. 
		Electro and his group went to the right path and my group and I went to the left path, and as we were walking Powerwoman stopped. "What's wrong?" I asked. "Err... there are five Elemental Water Monsters right in front of us" said Powerwoman in a shaky voice. 
		"So? No problem I can handle them" said Flameboy. "Don't get too confident. Elemental Water Monsters can combine with each other to form a Mega Elemental Water Monster" I said. 
		"Oh... nice to know" said Flameboy worriedly. "I'll start off. Follow my lead" I said. So I ran straight up at the first monster and attacked him with my sword, but then the monsters started attacking me. 
		Then one of them threw me at a wall. Then Flameboy shot him with big ball of fire, while Multiplier F shielded me with a force field. Then Flameboy ran up to one of them and smashed it straight through a wall killing it with his fists of fire. 
		"Nice work, keep going" I said in a quiet voice. Then Metollo controlled the two sides of the cave smashed one of them in the head stunning it and then he controlled the rocks to cover his fist and then ran at the monster and killed it. 
		After that LightforceX flashed a bright beam of light at the third monster blinding it and then ran straight through it at the speed of light slicing it in half. He was about to go through the fourth one, but then it combined with the fifth one to form a Mega Elemental Water Monster. 
		"Oh my God, that is one big monster" said Flameboy. "Told you so" I said jokingly. "Forget that, how're we going to fight that thing?" said Flameboy. "Let's try hitting it together" I said. "At the same time?" asked LightforceX. 
		"No. I have a plan. LightforceX blinds the monster with a flash of light then Metollo, locks his legs his to the ground by controlling the ground. After that Powerwoman and I will shoot it with a blast of elemental energy while Flameboy blasts it with fire and Multiplier F shoots it with his laser vision ok?" I asked. 
		"Ehh sorry, could you run me through that again. I forgot to take notes." said Flameboy sarcastically. "No time! Let's go" I said in return. And just like my plan LightforceX first blinded it with a flash of light then Metollo locked it to the ground. After that me and Powerwoman started blast it with energy while Flameboy blasted the monster with fire and Multiplier F blasted it with his laser vision.
		But still that wasn't enough for the monster. "Now what do we do" asked Flameboy. "I have an idea" I said. Then I charged up my sword with lightning and attacked it with my sword and then the monster finally fell to its knees dead. "Great, we've finally killed this, thing" said Flameboy. 
		"Finally! It was starting to get on my nerves" muttered Metollo. "How is the other group doing?" asked Powerwoman. "I don't know, let me check" I replied. I switched my comm-link on. "Hey, Electro come in. Hello?" I asked. "Oh hey, yeah we're kinda busy, Hi-yaaa..." said Electro. "...yeah guys, err... they're battling a monster" I said with worried look in my eye. 
		"Finally we're done. How about you guys?" asked Electro with a sigh of relief. "Oh we were already done. We just wanted to see how far you guys were. Anyway we're going down to the Treasure Room meet you on the other side. Over and out" I replied. "Alright, let's do this" said Metollo. 
		And with that he made a hole in the ground by controlling the earth beneath us. Then we jumped down and landed in a room filled with crystals and gold. "Wow. So this is the Treasure Room... nice" said LightforceX with a smile. "Let's take as much as we can" said Flameboy. 
		And I zapped back the magic chest and filled it with the gold coins and crystals. Then a few seconds later, six people fell from a hole in the ceiling which was blasted by a bolt of lightning. It was Electro and his group. "Whew, it's nice to see you guys again" said Powerwoman with a sigh. "Same" replied Electra. 
		"Now, according to the EP there should be a door right about here" said Electro touching a part of the wall. Electro looked to find that there was no door. "Err... Electro are you sure you're reading that thing correctly, cause there doesn't seem to be a door there..."said SpeedoX. 
		"Yes I can see that" said Electro angrily. He sighed. "What's wrong with this thing? I've checked it over and over again and there's supposed to be a door here" said Electro sadly. "Hey, maybe it's a fake wall. Let me try smashing it" said Metollo. "Err, I don't think that's a good idea" said Electro. 
		Despite that, he controlled a large boulder from the wall and hurled it straight at the point where the door should have been. It smashed straight through the wall. Metollo smiled. "Don't even think about it" said Electro angrily. "Told you so" said Metollo with a big grin on his face. "Ok, I think we should stop here for the night to rest and upgrade our equipment" I said. 
		"Here? Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea... a monster called just break in here and rip us to shreds" said Flameboy. "It'll be ok. I'll just reinforce these walls with some of the gold we got by morphing it" replied Metollo happily. "Ok" sighed Flameboy. 
		While Electro and I were upgrading the equipment Metollo started reinforcing the walls with the gold we found there, and the rest of the gold was used to reinforce the armour, swords and the machines. After we had done that we went to sleep there for the night. 
		The morning after that I awoke to hear banging sounds, after a while the others also woke up. "What was that?" asked Shrinkara in a scared voice. "Calm down calm down, it's probably just another monster" muttered Metollo. "A m-monster?" asked Flameboy in a quiet voice. 
		"Yes, your not afraid are you?" asked Metollo teasingly. "No... not at all. Nothings better than starting the morning by killing a monster" answered Flameboy shakily in a scared voice. Suddenly the monster started ramming the reinforced wall. "What kind of monster does that sound like Electro?" asked Shrinkara. 
		"I don't know let me check the MI..." replied Electro and with that everyone looked at him with a bewildered look on their faces. "MI is short for Monster Identifier," explained Electro with a sigh "An MI can identify a monster by its voice, picture or sample of its DNA" continued Electro. 
		"So have you scanned it yet?" asked Shrinkara worried. "Yes, it seems to be an Earth Rhino" replied Electro. "What's that?" asked Flameboy shakily. "It's a Rhino that can control earth" explained Electro. "No problem I can control anything that's hard" said Metollo confidently. 
		Then the Earth Rhino smashed through the wall and confronted us. "Err, you never said it was huge" whispered Spikeboy shakily. "I said it was a rhino. Rhinos are huge" whispered Electro sternly. "I don't care whether it's huge or not, I'm not scared" shouted Metollo, and with that he charged with his fists reinforced with gold and broke the horns on the rhino's head. 
		The rhino shook its head in frustration and charged at Metollo. Then Multiplier F shielded Metollo with a force field. "Thanks" said Metollo. "No problem" answered Multiplier F grinning. "You can't take it out on your own, Metollo" I shouted, "It's too powerful, we need to work together". "What should we do, Electro?" asked Multiplier I. 
		"The MI says an Earth Rhino's weakest point is its belly... let's try hitting it there" suggested Electro. "But how are we supposed to hit it there if it keeps charging at us?" asked Shrinkara. "Simple, Multiplier I turns invisible, doublegangs, goes under the rhino and shoots it with laser vision" I answered. "M-me?" asked Multiplier I. "Yes" I nodded. 
		"Fine, as long as you guys distract it" said Multiplier I grumpily. "Ok" I replied happily, and with that Multiplier I turned invisible, duplicated and headed straight for the Rhino's belly while we were distracting it. Once Multiplier I was below the belly of the Earth Rhino, Metollo surrounded it with four walls shooting up from the ground by the earth beneath us. 
		But the Rhino controlled the wall in front of it back down to the ground. Before the monster could charge at us Multiplier I and his duplicates shot a blast of laser vision at the Rhino's belly, defeating it. "Wow, that was harder than I thought" exclaimed Metollo. "Hey guys, the Earth Rhino came out of another room" shouted Aquagirl. 
		Everyone went to look at the room she was talking about. It was a dome-shaped room with three other rooms connected to it. In the middle of the room was a man. He looked like a guide. "Excuse me, sir but who are you?" I asked. "I am Speed Lightning. I'm a racing guide" he answered, "Are you guys lost?" asked Speed. 
		"We just wanted to know where those doors lead to" explained Electro. "The first door leads to the galactic racing store where you can buy vehicles, equipment, weapons, fuel and upgrades for your vehicle..."explained Speed, "What currency does the store accept?" asked Powerwoman. "There is special Galactic card that you can get in the store which you can top-up with any currency. 
		The exchange rates are shown as well" replied Speed. "What currency do the cards use?" asked Powerwoman. "They use Credits" replied Speed, "The second room is a Testing Area, where you can test your vehicle and see if it is up to the standard you wanted it to be" continued Speed, "Cool, can't wait to check that out!" exclaimed Electro. 
		"And the third room is the entrance to the ultimate galactic race. Unfortunately the room is locked as to ensure that the track is not tampered with before the race and to keep most monsters away. Although it will be opened three days before the big race" explained Speed. 
		"Ok guys, I think we should go to the Galactic Race Shop to see if there is anything for us to change in the Tri-Machine, and to get the Galactic card" I suggested. With that everyone nodded in agreement and went to the Galactic Racing Store.
