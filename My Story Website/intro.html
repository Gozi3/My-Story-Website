            <p>I was in the garage room working on my new invention 'The Tri-Machine'. It was a vehicle that can turn into a supersonic car, jet and aqua-boat (which is half boat and half submarine). To add to all of that, it was also made out of ultra-titanium
                which is a metal that's capable of withstanding great amounts of damage.</p>
            <p>&nbsp; But before I tell you what happened I think I should tell you all about our head-quarter and my team-mates. Our head-quarter is mainly where we stay. It looks amazing! In fact, it's thousands of feet below a massive activity centre
                called the Mega-dome. Our head-quarter is technologically advanced. If you want to eat, there's a restaurant that enables tables and chairs to be extended up from a hidden space underneath the ground, by the push of a button. We also have
                quite a lot of shops there. We have a game room in which every type of game can be found there. There is a video game section, a physical body games section, a board game section, and a sound game section. We also have robots that clean
                up the place because who else would really want to clean up a place this big. We have a lot of rooms which are customisable. You can change the style of the room by just simply thinking of the colour or design, thanks to our newly installed
                cerebral connection system (CCS). We have a garage room where we store all of our vehicles, a submarine line out with a secret water line out and a fully equipped gym with state-of-the-art machines. We also have a dimensional portal which
                is connected to almost any dimension. In addition to all of these facilities, we have our beloved invention room where you can make anything you know how to make to your hearts content. This is where Electro and I usually spend most of
                our time and that's just about how our secret HQ looks like.</p>
