		<p>Anyway, back to the story. I was working on my new invention called the Tri-Machine, and finally finished it at last! Then I went to test it in the testing arena, to see whether it worked or not and if it worked as good as I thought. So, I turned on the enemy robots the lasers and the jungle and safari environment, to see if it could work perfectly in such conditions. I changed the Tri-Machine into a supersonic car and automatically, just like I programmed, the jungle wheels in the supersonic car came out and the guns and lasers started shooting at the enemy robots. "Great, it works perfectly... in the jungle. Hmm, let's see if it can still operate in thunderstorms and extreme types of weathers from different places" I said. So I decided to change the environment to that of Climatia's, which was a planet known to have a lot of extreme types of weather including thunderstorms with a lot of lightning and tornados. Then it occurred to me. "Hmm, would it be able to fly in space?" I wondered. So I tested the pressure it could handle and it was even able to handle a pressure a lot stronger than that of space. "Great! Anyway back to the climate test" I said happily, "Computer, change surroundings to Climatia's" I said commanding the computer to do so, and it did. The first extreme weather type I chose was a huge thunderstorm with plenty of lightning. I turned the Tri-Machine into a supersonic jet and started flying through the thundery sky. Then when lightning struck the jet the lightning shields I designed automatically turned on and deflected the bolt lightning away from the jet. Then I flew straight at the tornado and the wind shields kicked in and stabilised the jet. "Awesome!" I shouted, happy to see to see my invention working. After realising that the Tri-Machine could work well in windy and electric conditions I then changed the climate very hot, and the Tri-Machine was able to perform perfectly. Deciding to see how much heat it could handle I changed the surroundings to that of the sun, and it worked just as well as it did in the hot climate of Climatia's. I switched the surroundings back to Climatia's, and went to a very cold climate. The temperature was at absolute zero, which is the coldest temperature ever that can be reached. The engine's fuel started to freeze as it got closer to absolute zero, so had to adjust the vehicle to inject a special liquid called Heathium into the fuel when the temperature got too cold, to stop the fuel from freezing. After doing that I tested it again and it worked perfectly. Then I changed the surroundings to a poisonous planet to see if it could withstand different poisonous gases. It worked well, then I changed the Tri-Machine into a supersonic aquaboat and when into the poisonous, swampy oceans and it worked perfectly as well. When I had finished testing the Tri-Machine in the testing arena, I went to the galactic mail room to see if we had any mail. There was one envelope there. "I wonder what this is" I said. I opened to meet an invitation to the annual 'Ultimate Galactic Race' held every year on Acmetropolis.
		On the envelope it said "To the members of the 'Supersixes' and 'Fifteenics' superhero team, you are invited to watch or participate in the annual 'Ultimate Galactic Race' competition.
		Racers from all across the galaxy will be there to attend in this magnificent race.
		Beware! Not only are many of the racers well experienced but their cars as well will be state of the art.
		If you are to participate in the race, show-up one week in advance and you will be entered into to it.
		Admission for the race is free, and all that's needed is you, your crew and your car.
		Expenses for getting to the race, buying equipment for your vehicle and other things needed for the race will not be included and will have to be paid by the person purchasing it.
		"Awesome! I can't wait to tell the rest of the team about the invitation, and also about my new invention, 'The Tri-Machine'.
		I gathered my teammates together.
		"Hey guys, I got the invitation to 'The Ultimate Galactic Race' and I was wondering if anyone would like to go with me to it" I said.
		"I once watched 'The Ultimate Galactic Race'. It's awesome!
		You get to watch different kinds of racing machines racing across the universe" said Electro.
		"So who wants to enter it with me?" I asked "Me", shouted twelve voices coming from different places.
		I looked around and there was Powerwoman, Electro, Electra, Flameboy, LightforceX, SpeedoX, Aquagirl, Metollo, Shrinkara, Spikeboy, Multiplier I, and Multiplier F. "OK", I said.
		"What about the rest of you guys? Don't you want to come?" I said.
		"Nah, I think we'll stay back. Plus someone's gotta take care of the other planets and protect the people from the bad guys while you guys are gone", said Star Catboy. "Good point. Oh, and guys by the way, I just created a brand new invention". I removed the cover from the Tri-Machine."WOW", said everybody. "You have definitely outdone yourself this time", said Electra."Wait a second did Electro help you?" said Star Catboy."No, he didn't, I did it all by myself. It took a while but it was worth the time." I said. "Yeah Right, as if you did that all by yourself." said Star Catboy. "But I did..." "Its true guys he did do it on his own, I didn't help him with it. I was even surprised when I saw it", said Electro. "Oh, ok I believe you. So what's it called?" asked Star Catboy. "Yeah, what's it called?" asked everyone. "I call it 'The Tri-Machine' because it can turn into three things, a supersonic jet, a supersonic car, and a supersonic aquaboat." I said as I demonstrated for them.
		"Wow, Cool," said everyone excitedly. "That's gotta be more than what we need to win the race" said Flameboy. "True, but don't forget other racers from all around the galaxy are coming to race. They may have stuff that we might not have even dreamt of, never mind building", I said. "Well?" said Flameboy. "Well what?" I asked back. "Well you'll never know until you actually check them out!" said Flameboy excitedly. "What do you mean?" I asked confused.  "Why don't we actually go to the place to check out the other racer's car, and see whether we need to change or modify The Tri-Machine", said Flameboy. "Good idea! Guys lets go" I said. "Actually I don't think we should go" said Electro. "Why?" we asked. "Well, I was watching the intergalactic news yesterday and it said there's going to be a freak thunderstorm this week and..." "That won't stop us. The Tri-Machine can handle anything; it has elemental shields, which include lightning shields, fire shields, ice shields..." "I know what it includes, I made them" mumbled Electro. So we started on our way to the place where the Ultimate Galactic Race was going to be held. When we entered Acmetropolis there was thunder and lightning everywhere. Then suddenly the Tri-Machine started shaking. "Whoa!" said everyone. "I told you the Tri-Machine can't handle it" said Electro. "Yes, it can" I said. It shakes again. "Whoa!" said everyone. "Ah, I see what's wrong I forgot to turn the elemental shields on". I switched it on. "There we go" I said happily, and The Tri-Machine stopped shaking and gently flew. "There's the cave let's land there" said Electra. "Are you sure that's it? It looks pretty bad to me" I said. "The thunderstorm must have done this to it" said Electra. Then I gently landed the Tri-Machine. "I hope the thunderstorm didn't damage the Tri-Machine too much" I said. "Forget that, let's see what the other vehicles look like" said Powerwoman. "Err, how are we going to get it into the cave" said Aquagirl. "Well, Shrinkara and I were already working on that, and we made this button that makes things smaller and grows it back to its original size" said Electro. "Well what are you waiting let's test it" I said. "Alright" said Electro. He fixed it on. "Great it works!" I said. "Yes, now we can go" said Powerwoman. I shrunk the Tri-Machine and put it in my pocket. "I don't think it's a good idea to keep it in your pocket" said Flameboy. "Well where else do you want me to put it?" I asked him. "Well, you could always magically zap the lightweight magic chest we made. You know the one that never ends. We can zap it back when we don't need it and zap it back here when we do" said Flameboy. "Okay" I said. I zapped the magic chest to us and put the now mini-sized Tri-Machine into the magic chest and zapped it back. </p>
