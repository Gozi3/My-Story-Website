            <p>When we went in to the Galactic Racing Store we came in to meet a big room with a corridor at the left side of the room leading to a car showroom, and at the back of the showroom there was a room attached to it. There was a sign on the door
                saying 'Galactic Account Room'. "That's probably where you get your Galactic card from" said Powerwoman happily. Then someone answered from behind "That's right!" All of us startled turned around to meet a young female shop assistant with
                blond hair and glimmering blue eyes. "I'm Sandra Stargazer. I'm sorry there isn't anything in stock right now. I wasn't expecting any customers today. Eh, what brings you guys here?" continued the shop assistant. "We wanted to know what
                the place looked like and also to know whether our machine is great compared to the other racers from around the galaxy" explained Electro. "Well, I'm really sorry guys but no one has shown up yet. The race won't be starting until another
                two weeks" replied Sandra sadly. "Well then what are we supposed to do until then" asked Electra. "You guys can start applying for the Galactic cards" replied Sandra cheerfully. "Ok! Guys, let's go" said Powerwoman. So we went to the room
                at the back of the showroom, with the sign 'Galactic Account Room' on it. Inside was a screen that was slightly larger than that of an average flat screen TV, except it was a lot thinner and had a fully-functional touch screen. On the
                screen there were two buttons. The first one said "Click to credit your Galactic card", and the second one said "Click to apply for a Galactic card". So I clicked the second one. After that it told us to fill out the information. The information
                we had to fill out was what species/race we were e.g. human , what your name was, what age you were, where you lived exactly right down to the galaxy, the password you wanted for your account, your e-mail address and how much you were
                going to deposit into it to start. It accepted any currency; it even accepted normal paper as money since in Candy World they use paper instead of coins as money. So I deposited 100,000 GCs which is about &#x20AC 1,000,000 on Earth when
                converted, and pressed the send option, then I got my Galactic card made of gold with my name written on it through the slot in the machine. After me everyone else did the same thing and got their own Galactic card, made of gold with their
                names written on it through the slot and then came out of the room. | |We met Sandra running towards us shouting "Great news guys, the stocks have just arrived," "You can help me arrange them into their proper places" she continued. "Sure,
                why not? That should be fun..." muttered SpeedyX sarcastically. "We're fast! I can probably do it in two seconds. For you maybe five" replied LightForce. "For you five" mimicked SpeedyX under his breath. "Race you!" said LightForce with
                a grin. So LightForce and SpeedyX helped Sandra to bring the stock in. Then we all arranged it in the store. After arranging them we started looking through the stock to see if there was any good equipment we could use to make the Tri-Machine
                even better. "Unfortunately, the best equipment has not exactly arrived here yet" sighed Sandra. "That's ok we can take some of the fuel with us and upgrade it or maybe mix it with other fuels we have with us" said Electro. "And since
                you guys are my first customers you can have it for free" added Sandra. "Really?" asked Electro. "Yeah, just think of it as an honorary gift to the Phoenix Elementals" replied Sandra. "AND LEGIONARIES!" shouted Flameboy storming out of
                the room. "Don't mind him. He can be a bit of a hot-head if you know what I mean" I joked. "Hahaha, I understand" she chuckled. So we carried five barrels of the fuel which consisted of ten litres each, and another five barrels of nitrous
                fuel which consisted of five litres each. I created a portal to the Vehicle Room and maximized the Tri-Machine, now turned into a supersonic car and stored the fuel into the car and put it back in the Vehicle Room. "Thanks" said Aquagirl
                happily as the portal to the Vehicle room closed. "No problem, good luck in the race!" exclaimed Sandra with a smile.
