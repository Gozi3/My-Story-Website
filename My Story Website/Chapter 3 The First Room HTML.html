		When we went in to the Galactic Racing Store we came into meet a big room with a corridor at the left side of the room leading to a car showroom, and at the back of the showroom there was a room attached to it. There was a sign on the door saying 'Galactic Account Room'. "That's probably where you get your Galactic card from" said Powerwoman happily. Then someone answered from behind "That's right!" 
		All of us startled turned around to meet a young female shop assistant. "I'm Sandra Stargazer... I'm sorry there isn't anything in stock right now; I wasn't expecting any customers today. 
		Err... what brings you guys here?" continued the shop assistant. "We wanted to know what the place looked like and also to know whether our machine is great compared to the other racers from around the galaxy" explained Electro. "Well, I'm really sorry guys but no one has shown up yet. 
		The race won't be starting until another two weeks" replied Sandra sadly. "Well then what are we supposed to do until then" asked Electra. "You guys can start applying for the Galactic cards" replied Sandra cheerfully. "Ok! Guys, let's go" said Powerwoman enthusiastically. So we went to the room at the back of the showroom, with the sign 'Galactic Account Room' on it. 
		Inside was a screen that was slightly larger than that of an average flat screen TV, except it was a lot thinner and had a fully-functional touch screen. On the screen there were two buttons. The first one said "Click to credit your Galactic card", and the second one said "Click to apply for a Galactic card". So I clicked the second one. After that it told us to fill out the information. 
		The information we had to fill out was what species/race we were e.g. human , what your name was, what age you were, where you lived exactly right down to the galaxy, the password you wanted for your account, your e-mail address and how much you were going to deposit into it to start. 
		It accepted any currency; it even accepted normal paper as money since in Sweet Street they used paper instead of coins as money. 
		So I deposited when converted 100,000 Credits which was about &#x20AC 1,000,000 on Earth, and pressed the send option, then I got my Galactic card made of gold with my name written on it through the slot in the machine. After me everyone else did the same thing and got their own Galactic card, made of gold with their names written on it through the slot and then came out of the room. 
		| |We met Sandra running towards shouting "Great news guys, the stocks have arrived," "You can help me arrange them into their proper places" she continued. "Sure, why not?" said Flameboy happily. So Flameboy, Electro and I helped Sandra to arrange the stock. 
		After arranging them we started looking through the stock to see if there was any good equipment we could use to make the Tri-Machine even better. "Unfortunately, the best equipment has not exactly arrived here yet" sighed Sandra. 
		"That's ok we can take some of the fuel with us and upgrade it or maybe mix it with other fuels we have with us" said Electro. "And since you guys are my first customers you can take it for free" added Sandra. 
		So we carried five barrels of the fuel which consisted of ten litres each, and another five barrels of nitrous fuel which also consisted of ten litres each. I maximized the Tri-Machine, now turned into a supersonic car and stored the fuel into the car. "Thanks" said Aquagirl happily. 
		"No problem, good luck in the race!" exclaimed Sandra joyfully.
